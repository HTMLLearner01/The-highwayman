    <h2>Stanza 9- Will be Updated Soon</h2>


<div id="ld">

<h2> Stanza 10 </h2>
   <p> A-She <em>twisted</em> her hands behind her, but all the knots held <strong>good</strong>!</p>
<ul>
    <li>"twisted" is a kinaesthetic imagery(movement)</li>
    <li>"good" is a litote, because it is an understatement that the knots are strong</li>
</ul>

   <p>A*- <em>writhed</em> her hands till her fingers were <em>wet with sweat</em> or blood!</p>
<ul>
    <li>"writhed" means constant movements, wriggling</li>
   <li>"wet" is tactile imagery(touch)</li>
   <li>wet and sweet are masculine rhymes and identical rhymes, assonance for the letter "e"</li>
   <li>"good" and "blood" are off rhymes because they don't sound the same</li>

</ul>

    <p> B-They s<strong>t</strong>re<strong>t</strong>ched and strained in the dar<strong>k</strong>ness, and <e>t</e>he <em>hours</em> <strong>c</strong>raled by li<strong>k</strong>e <em>years,</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>"stretched and strained" are masculine rhymes because they are on stressed syllables and alliteration. </li>
<li>"darkness" is a visual auditory because it represents the absence of light</li>
<li>"crawled by like years" is a personification, hyperbole, and simile stating how long she feels. This is an internal sensation.</li>
<li>Cacophony for the bold words</li>
<li>"Hours" and "Years" are feminine rhymes because ours and ears are unstressed syllables</li>
</ul>

    <p>C-Till, on the stroke of midnight,</p>
<ul>
    <li>enjambment because the sentence continued without proper syntax</li>
<li>identical rhyme for "on the stroke of midnight", consonance, parallelism(same thing between stanza)</li>

</ul>

    <p>C-C<em>o</em>ld on the s<strong>t</strong>r<em>o</em><strong>k</strong>e of midnigh<strong>t</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>identical rhyme</li>
        <li>"Cold" is a tactile imagery</li>
        <li>"Cold" and "stroke" are internal rhymes, consonance</li>
        <li>Cacophony for the bold words.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>B-The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers<strong>!</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>"!" is interjection</li>
</ul>
