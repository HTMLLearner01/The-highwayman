   <h3> A-She <strong>twisted</strong> her hands behind her, but all the knots held <strong>good</strong>!</h3>
<ul>
    <li>"twisted" is a kinaesthetic imagery(movement)</li>
    <li>"good" is a litote, because it is an understatement that the knots are strong</li>
</ul>

   <h3>A*- <em>writhed</em> her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!</h3>
<ul>
    <li>"writhed" means constant movements, wriggling</li>
   <li>"wet" is tactile imagery(touch)</li>
   <li>wet and sweet are masculine rhymes and identical rhymes</li>
   <li>"good" and "blood" are off rhymes because they don't sound the same</li>

</ul>

    <h3> B-They s<em>t</em>re<em>t</em>ched and strained in the dar<em>k</em>ness, and <e>t</e>he hours <em>c</em>raled by li<em>k</em>e years,</h3>
<ul>
    <li>"stretched and strained" are masculine rhymes because they are on stressed syllables and alliteration</li>
<li>"darkness" is a visual auditory because it represents the absence of light</li>
<li>"crawled by like years" is a personification, hyperbole, and simile stating how long she feels. This is an internal sensation.</li>
<li>Cacophony for the italisized words</li>
</ul>

    <h3>C-Till, on the stroke of midnight,</h3>
<ul>
    <li>enjambment because the sentence continued without proper syntax</li>
<li>identical rhyme for "on the stroke of midnight", consonance, parallelism(same thing between stanza)</li>


</ul>

    <h3>C-Cold on the stroke of midnight</h3>


    <h3>B-The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!</h3>
