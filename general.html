   <p>This poem is about a girl, Bess, who falls in love with a highwayman. However, Tim also loves Bess, so he informed the king's guards about their relationship.
        When the highwayan left to steal fortune, the king's guards immediately captured Bess and teased her. Bess grabbed a pistol and shot herself to warn the highwayman not 
        to come back. However, the highwayman still came back for revenge and got shot. The last two stanzas repeat the first two stanza, which shows the theme of eternal love.</p>
