    <h1>Mood</h1>
    <p>The mood in the 9th stanza contrast greatly than the mood of the 10th stanza. In the 9th stanza, 
        the king's guards had tied her up, teased her, and tortured her. The mood was gloomy, and we can sense that something bad 
        is going to happen to Bess. It was also very desperate because it seemed impossible for Bess to do anything. However, after long times of constant struggle, she finally gets holld of a gun, 
        and the mood becomes cheerful because it's hopeful that she can overcome the king's guards.
